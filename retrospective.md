# things i did wrong

-    committed too much too fast on the amount of things i supported. Ended up spending more time adding the languages / keybinds / vim integration than making it work. now adding a feature becomes an herculean task because i would need to change a lot of lines to add something specific
-    file structure was poorly planned, felt clueless
-    very new environment, didnt know a lot of things
-    instead of having objects on commands and on the loop adding functionality, should have done the other way around

```js
command_name: new Command(name, action, props);
```

-    could have 1 context with every thing on it.
-    didnt need to have the mindset of super extensability

# things i did right

-    fast to iterate (at least in the beginning). Because it was fast to develop i could use it right away and see the potential

-    focused on the details. that was nice, i think that the keybinds and shortcuts are really sweet

# things i want to try out

a global types, no need to import them out
