# Vscode Text Objects

## Roadmap

### Reverse select / go to

the idea is for all the commands that we have access to (select next function. go to next if statement) there would be a reverse to that. currently proven objects are functioning.

-    functions

### Node Support

The current Fully supported nodes are:

-    Functions
-    Loops
-    Strings
-    Arrays
-    Objects
-    Comments

The current in development nodes are

-    Conditionals: unsure if they work in all cases
-    Variables: unsure if they work in all cases
-    Variable assignments:
     -    unsure if they work in all cases
     -    only work in assignment for the first time, working on whenever the variable is assigned the subsequent times
-    Types: very bare bones (only in typescript and only on type and interface creations)
-    Inner Strings: Only supported in javascript for now
-    Calls: only started
-    inner Calls: only started

#### Possible nodes support

Blocks:

Blocks would be nice catch all.

## Disclaimer

Although i like this extension, I am uncertain about the development past my needs. Since extension development is not my career (at least not for now). I dont intend to have a lot going on for this extension.
