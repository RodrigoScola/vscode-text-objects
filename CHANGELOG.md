# Change Log

## [0.1.32]

In the continuation to make `Vscode-Text-Objects` a seemless integration with vscode and the vim extension. We've done some updates to how we handle the configuration and keybinds.

The biggest change is that some keybinds overwrote vim default motions, we've updated the default keybindings. Some of you might be affected if you use the `parameters`, `strings` and `type` motions. If you want the previous keybinds, i suggest you to change it on te configuration file or in the `shortcuts` tab.

-    Non obstructive vim keybindings. (#3; Thanks to [Josh](https://github.com/JoshPaulie))

-    Added a `getting_started.md` guide for vim users.

-    Updated vim keybindings were clauses that were covered by the vim extension by default

-    Added a [support me page](https://ko-fi.com/rodrigoscola) (#2; Thanks to [Rob](https://github.com/RobPruzan))
